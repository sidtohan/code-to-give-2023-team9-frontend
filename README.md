## ABOUT
*BREADS Bangalore [Bangalore Rural Educational And Development Society]*

Website: https://breadsbangalore.org/

- BREADS focuses on childcare and healthcare including prevention of drug abuse and addiction among children youth and rehabilitation. 

- After observing the trend of increasing drug use in Kerala, BREADS responded to the situation with an initiative called **DREAM [Drug Rehabilitation Education And Mentoring]**.

- So far, all data collected after training sessions(such as how many people are enrolled in counselling programs, where are they from) is collected manually using pen and paper or using spreadsheets.

In order to help them with digitalization of data collection, our team has decided to create a web application to assist BREADS in their noble mission.
